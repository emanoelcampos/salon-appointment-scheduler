# Salon Appointment Scheduler 

*Learning Documentation*

This project was developed as part of the [FreeCodeCamp's Relational Database certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/). The main goal was to create an interactive `Bash` program that uses `PostgreSQL` to manage customers and appointments for a salon.

## Database Diagram

This diagram provides a visual representation of the database structure, including tables and the relationships between them.

## Script Analysis

The project includes a `Bash` script (`script/appointment-script.sh`) that interacts with the `PostgreSQL` database. Here's a brief overview of what I learned from this script:

- **Database Interaction**: The script uses the `psql` command-line interface to interact with the `PostgreSQL` database. This includes executing `SQL` queries to `retrieve`, `insert`, and `update` data in the database.

- **User Interaction**: The script prompts the user for input and uses this input to perform various operations. For example, it asks the user to select a service, provide their phone number, and specify a time for their appointment.

- **Data Validation**: The script includes checks to validate the user's input. For example, it checks if the selected service ID is a number and if it exists in the database.

- **Data Manipulation**: The script uses SQL queries to manipulate data in the database. For example, it inserts a new customer into the `customers` table if the provided phone number does not exist in the database.

- **Shell Scripting**: The script demonstrates various shell scripting concepts, such as defining functions, using conditional statements, and reading user input.

This project provided valuable experience in using Bash scripting to interact with a PostgreSQL database, validating user input, and manipulating data based on this input.
